We've been asked by people who want to learn more about IT where they should start. There's no right place to begin - our recommendation is always to keep trying until you find something you enjoy and start from there!

But if you're looking for something more specific, we're creating a list here of websites and courses that you might find useful.

We're only adding free (or freemium) courses for now, so you can start learning without being out of pocket.

Are we missing resources that you found useful? Feel free to reach out to us, or make a pull request on Github!
