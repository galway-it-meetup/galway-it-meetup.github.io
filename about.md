We are the Galway Information Technology Meetup! We meet once a month, in the Portershed on Market St. Galway. Our meetup is for those who work in IT, want to work in IT, or who just love tech and want to learn more about it! Everyone is welcome to join our events, to submit ideas and topics, and to give talks about your passion projects or favourite new tool or language!

## Meet the Organisers

### Liam

Liam is our founder! He set up the meetup in 2023, seeing a lack of opportunity for those in IT to meet up, learn new things, and to share knowledge. 

A software engineer of many years, he's worked for several Galway start-ups and is currently working for Fleet-Ops in the Portershed! He also presented a paper at the 2012 IEEE International Games Innovation Conference.

He's spoken several times on his passion projects and topics that have caught his eye. You can reach him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamkrewer/) or via [email](mailto:liam@galwayit.org)

Aisling has been helping out behind the scences since the meetup started.

A developer support specialist transitioning to cybersecurity, she's also running the Instagram page, and has taken over the website and emails for the group!

She's spoken on OWASP, self-hosting and smart home tech! You can reach her on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aislingkrewer/) or via [email](mailto:hello@galwayit.org)
